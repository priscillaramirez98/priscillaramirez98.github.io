  <p>Hello, let me start by telling you a little bit about myself. My name is Priscilla, i'm 17 and I just recently moved to Dinuba from Long Beach. I was so heart broken when I found out I was moving from a big city to a little town no one knows about. I love to explore the world so I like to do things like hiking, trying new types of food, or even the smallest things may catch my attention like adventuring amusement parks. </p>

       <p>Right now I am still attending high school but it's my seinor year. After I graduate from high school I want to attend CSULB. This will be a dream come true. Returning to the place I lived my whole life will make me so happy. No one has an idea how happy I will be. Probably like a little kid with a lot of presents on christmas.</p>
